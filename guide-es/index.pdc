% Felix's Node.js Guide

## About this guide

Hi, I am [Felix Geisend√∂rfer][felixge], an early [node.js][nodejs] core
contributor and co-founder of [transloadit.com][transloadit].

Over the past few months I have given a lot of [talks][talks] and done a lot of
[consulting][consulting] on using node.js.

Since I found myself repeating a lot of things over and over, I decided to use
some of my recent vacation to start this opinionated and unofficial guide to
help people getting started in node.js.

## Content

[Node.js Convincing The Boss Guide](convincing_the_boss.html)

    benefits.

More guides are in the works. Feel free to follow the [GitHub repository][repo],
